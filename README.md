# mastodon-instance-leftovers

Some things from the time I was running my own Mastodon instance between March 2021 and August 2022:

* list of relays I was subscribed to
* Code of Conduct adapted to a reality of a single-user Mastodon instance that doesn't accept external registrations. Some relays require each subscribing instance to have server rules / code of conduct in place, so I decided to write my own :)

If you're planning to self-host your own Mastodon instance, good luck and godspeed! I also encourage you to read [my friendly advice for Mastodon single-user instance owners](https://www.offbeatbits.com/self-hosting-mastodon-for-the-adventurous/).
