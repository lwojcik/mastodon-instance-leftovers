<h1>Code of conduct</h1>

Being an administrator, a moderator and a user on my own self-hosted Mastodon instance I have no privacy policy or terms of service I could effectively enforce on myself. However, I am fully aware that with great power comes great responsibility and I do not live in a vacuum. I acknowledge the existence and fully support <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/covenant">Mastodon Server Covenant</a>.
<br/><br/>
I run this instance in good faith within laws imposed on me by the country I live in, as well as terms and conditions of my service providers, including my web hosting provider, domain registrar and many others.
<br/><br/>
As a mature citizen of the internet community I abide by very simple rules: I know there's a human on the other side of the screen and I don't do things I wouldn't do to my grandma. I strongly support this old-fashioned notion of being excellent to each other.
<br/><br/>
This Mastodon instance is not a public service. All accounts hosted on this instance are 100% owned and moderated by me. I do not offer account registration to third parties. Should that ever change in the future I will convert this page into proper terms of service.
<br/><br/>
Bot accounts on this instance are clearly labelled. I strive to design and run them in a way they don't cause disruptions to other parties and I monitor their behavior.
<br/><br/>
I use content warnings and mark relevant media as sensitive if they contain NSFW content.
<br/><br/>
I do not support nor engage in hate speech, harassment, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia or other forms of discrimination.
<br/><br/>
I do not support nor engage in disinformation campaigns or conspiracy theories undermining public health.
<br/><br/>
If you notice any unexpected behavior that can be traced back to my instance and doesn't align with the standards I described above, <a href="https://www.lukaszwojcik.net/contact/">please contact me directly</a>. Thank you!
